## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Victor
- ðŸ“š I'm a Computer Science student at UFU (Federal University of Uberlandia) in Brazil;
- I'm currently interested in Cryptography, Back-End and Mobile development and problems resolutions;
- I like to code with Java, Python, Kotlin, and sometimes JavaScript. But I believe that programming languages are just tools that we should use to solve problems.
