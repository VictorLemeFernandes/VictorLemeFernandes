# It doesn’t matter if you know “how”, if you don’t know “why”.
### Hi there 👋 my name is Victor Leme
- 📚 I'm a Computer Science student at UFU (Federal University of Uberlandia) in Brazil;
- I'm currently interested in Cryptography, Back-End development and problems resolutions;
- I like to code with Java, Python, and sometimes JavaScript. But I believe that programming languages are just tools that we should use to solve problems.
